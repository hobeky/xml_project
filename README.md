### task user-XML CRUD page
For task i have used Symfony framework on backend and twig templates on frontend. Whole project is wrapped in docker for symfony projects (https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker). Code implementation is using controller->service->so called manager approach. Each class is responsible for one thing (although XmlHandlerService can be divided more but with limited time I think is ok).

Updating entity (adding or removing properties)
1. backend
- update entity + assertions + getters/setters
- add/remove setter in XmlHandlerService->editUserLogic()
2. frontend
- update show.html.twig + index.html.twig

Thoughts:
- it would be nice to create migration script after add/remove property from user so data will be consistent also with some check if data are corrupted
- without more information i think it will be better to use database for storage users and have buttons to export data for desired format such as xml/csv/xslx or so


Things to improve:
- bootstrap is now linked via url addres, better approach will be install it via encore bundle
- add unit tests
- maybe mobile version of page, now is created for desktop use




# Symfony Docker

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based installer and runtime for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) web framework,
with [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev) and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) inside!

![CI](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. Run `docker compose build --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up --pull always -d --wait` to start the project
4. Open `https://localhost/user/` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.

## Features

* Production, development and CI ready
* Just 1 service by default
* Blazing-fast performance thanks to [the worker mode of FrankenPHP](https://github.com/dunglas/frankenphp/blob/main/docs/worker.md) (automatically enabled in prod mode)
* [Installation of extra Docker Compose services](docs/extra-services.md) with Symfony Flex
* Automatic HTTPS (in dev and prod)
* HTTP/3 and [Early Hints](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-6-3-early-hints) support
* Real-time messaging thanks to a built-in [Mercure hub](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mercure.html)
* [Vulcain](https://vulcain.rocks) support
* Native [XDebug](docs/xdebug.md) integration
* Super-readable configuration

**Enjoy!**
